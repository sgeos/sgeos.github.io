The [Panic Playdate][playdate] is a tiny, just-for-fun indie game console.
This post will discuss getting started with the Panic Playdate.
It will cover downloading the [SDK][playdate_sdk_latest], installing it,
and running the examples.
macOS will be used, but the steps should be largely the same for other
platforms.
Familiarity with the command line is assumed.

## Instructions

#### Installation

First, download the [latest Playdate SDK][playdate_sdk_latest]
(link to [all versions][playdate_sdk_all]) from the
[Playdate Developer Page][playdate_dev].
Update the path, set the SDK path, and consider adding an alias for the
Playdate simulator.

{% highlight sh %}
# update path
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/Developer/PlaydateSDK/bin:${PATH}"' >> "${HOME}/.profile"

# set the Playdate SDK path
echo 'export PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH="${HOME}/Developer/PlaydateSDK"' >> "${HOME}/.bash_profile"

# add alias for simulator
echo 'alias playdate_simulator="open ${HOME}/Developer/PlaydateSDK/bin/Playdate\ Simulator.app"' >> "${HOME}/.bash_profile"

# reload profiles, if necessary
. "${HOME}/.profile"
. "${HOME}/.bash_profile"
{% endhighlight %}

#### Pulp

[Pulp][playdate_pulp] is a web-based game editor for the Playdate.
The target audience is entry-level game developers and people who want to
rapidly prototype.
All development and testing can be done in the browser.
Pulp has a lot of limitations, but it is also
[easy to learn][playdate_pulp_tutorials]!
(Links to documentation for [Pulp][playdate_pulp_docs] and
[PulpScript][playdate_pulpscript_docs].)
Pulp is a good choice for people who are not ready to learn to program.

Entire games can be exported and imported in JSON format.
To run a game developed with Pulp in the simulator, click the "DOWNLOAD PDX"
button, and then pass the PDX file to the simulator.

{% highlight sh %}
GAME="my-game"
GAME_PATH="${HOME}/Downloads"
playdate_simulator "${GAME_PATH}/${GAME}.pdx"
{% endhighlight %}

#### Lua Examples

Lua can also be used to develop Playdate games.
The target audience is moderately sophisticated developers.
Lua is a popular scripting language commonly used in game development,
and the Lua API is not as restricted as Pulp's web-based development model.
(Link to [Lua documentation][playdate_lua_docs].)
Lua is generally the best choice for projects with a programmer.

Regular project-based Lua examples can be run as follows.

{% highlight sh %}
# cd to location of examples directory
cd "${HOME}/Developer/PlaydateSDK/Examples/"

# run the "2020" exmaple
EXAMPLE="2020"
pdc "${EXAMPLE}/Source" "${EXAMPLE}.pdx"
playdate_simulator "${EXAMPLE}".pdx

# cleanup file when no longer needed
rm -rf "${EXAMPLE}.pdx"
{% endhighlight %}

Single file Lua examples can be run as follows.

{% highlight sh %}
# cd to location of examples directory
cd "${HOME}/Developer/PlaydateSDK/Examples/"

# run the "animator" exmaple
EXAMPLE="animator"
pdc -m "Single File Examples/${EXAMPLE}.lua" "${EXAMPLE}.pdx"
playdate_simulator "${EXAMPLE}.pdx"

# cleanup file when no longer needed
rm -rf "${EXAMPLE}.pdx"
{% endhighlight %}

#### C API Examples

Sophisticated developers can use the C API to make software for the Playdate.
Many professional AAA game developers use C++, but C is the language they used
in the past.
(Link to [C API documentation][playdate_c_api_docs].)
Only use the C API if you know why you need to use it.

The C API examples can be run as follows.

{% highlight sh %}
# cd to location of examples directory
cd "${HOME}/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/Examples/"

# run the "3D library" exmaple
EXAMPLE="3D library"
(cd "./${EXAMPLE}"; make; playdate_simulator *.pdx)

# cleanup file when no longer needed
(cd "./${EXAMPLE}"; make clean)
{% endhighlight %}
