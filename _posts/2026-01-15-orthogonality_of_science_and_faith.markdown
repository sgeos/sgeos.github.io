In college, I took a fascinating class on the philosophy of science that
deeply shaped my present understanding of science and faith. My main takeaway
from that class was the idea that science and faith are orthogonal. This means
that they operate independently of one another, serving different roles in how
we perceive and interact with the world. Science is everything that can be
measured and falsified, while faith encompasses beliefs held without measured
evidence.

## The Scientific Method and Why It Works

To understand the distinction between science and faith, it is important first
to define what science is and why it works.

Science is grounded in the scientific method, which involves observing the
world, forming hypotheses based on those observations, and testing those
hypotheses through experiments. The defining feature of the scientific method
is its requirement for falsifiability. For any theory to be valid, there must
be a way to test it and potentially prove it wrong. A theory is not considered
true until it has been rigorously tested and validated by experiments that can
be independently verified.

For example, Newton’s laws of motion were once thought to be universally
applicable. However, Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity provided a more
accurate framework, particularly for understanding the universe at extreme
speeds. This shift did not invalidate Newton’s laws. It merely showed that
they were a special case of a broader theory. Science thrives on this
iterative process of revisiting and refining existing knowledge. It is this
constant testing and revision that makes science so effective in explaining
the natural world.

## The Role of Faith in Everyday Life

While science deals with the measurable and falsifiable, faith concerns itself
with things that cannot be directly observed or proven. Faith is the belief in
concepts or outcomes that we accept as true despite the absence of concrete
evidence or scientific proof. In everyday life, everyone relies on faith,
whether religious or not.

For example, when I go to sleep at night, I do so with the faith that I will
wake up in the morning, despite the fact that people die in their sleep every
day. The alternative is living every day as though it is actually my last.
Similarly, when I drive my car, I trust that I will reach my destination
safely, even though fatal accidents occur daily. I would not drive if I
believed the risks were significant. When I go to work, I have faith that I
will be paid for my labor, even though there are instances where wages go
unpaid. If I truly expected otherwise, I would not accept the job.

These examples show that I have faith in certain outcomes, even though others
may not share that trust. Similarly, holding the opposite view is itself an
act of faith, but refraining from holding a position is not. Incidentally,
insurance is based on the premise that some will be unlucky, but no one knows
who. It helps manage uncertainty, though it cannot always restore what is
lost, as a cash settlement will not undo the damage of a life-altering
accident.

In essence, everyone operates on some form of faith. Whether religious or not,
we constantly make decisions based on beliefs and assumptions that go beyond
what can be proven. Faith is a fundamental part of human life because we
cannot verify everything, yet we must still act based on predictions about the
future.

## Differentiating Between Empirical and Faith-Based Beliefs

It is crucial to differentiate between empirical beliefs, those based on
measurable, testable evidence, and faith-based beliefs, which are grounded in
trust, hope, or assumptions that cannot be realistically tested. This
distinction is key to communicating clearly and thoughtfully, especially when
our actions require both a combination of both empirical evidence and faith.

In many real-world scenarios, acts of faith must be made even within empirical
domains. For example, when solving a complex problem at work, you may have
confidence in your ability to identify and fix the issue. This confidence is
not based on evidence that the solution is already known, but rather on the
faith that, through effort and persistence, a solution will emerge. Sometimes,
this assumption will be proven false, but it is essential to move forward.

Similarly, consider the faith required in a business context. You may trust
that you will be able to meet client expectations, even when you do not have
concrete evidence that they are satisfied. This act of faith drives you to
take action, knowing that success often requires navigating uncertainty. Your
belief that you can win over support or meet goals, despite challenges, is a
vital part of your decision-making process. Despite your efforts, you may need
to work with a stakeholder who is bound and determined to be impossible to
please.

Recognizing these faith-based decisions helps us understand how faith
influences even the most practical, empirical parts of life. It also
encourages us to communicate more effectively by acknowledging the limits of
our knowledge and the role that trust and belief play in shaping our actions.

## Science and Faith in the Context of Metaphysics and Religion

A classical example of how science and faith intersect lies in the realms of
metaphysics and religion. Some scientists have faith in metaphysical concepts,
such as the belief that the universe cannot be random or that it must have
been created by a higher power or principle. While these scientists do not
have empirical evidence to support such beliefs, they hold them because they
refuse to believe that the universe could have emerged purely by chance.

On the other hand, some scientists have faith in the idea that metaphysical
concepts simply do not exist, that everything in the universe can be explained
by natural laws. This is also an act of faith because the nonexistence of
metaphysical ideas cannot be empirically tested or falsified. These scientists
argue that science should remain focused strictly on what can be observed and
measured, dismissing metaphysical ideas as irrelevant.

There are also many people who do not practice the scientific method but hold
faith in metaphysical beliefs, such as astrology or spiritualism. These
beliefs, though untestable by science, shape how these individuals interpret
their world. Other people who do not practice scientific rigor reject
conjectural positions, instead prioritizing direct, hands-on experience over
undemonstrated claims.

## Orthogonal Axes

The key point of this discussion is that science and faith are orthogonal,
meaning they are not in direct conflict but instead operate on different axes.
Science deals with what can be observed, measured, and tested. It seeks to
answer the “how” and “what” questions, explaining the mechanics of the world
around us. Faith, on the other hand, addresses questions and beliefs that go
beyond the empirical and the observable. It is concerned with the untestable,
the abstract, and often the deeply personal, often tackling the “why”
questions.

By understanding that science and faith are orthogonal, we can appreciate that
they do not contradict each other. They answer different kinds of questions.
Science explains physical laws, while faith offers meaning and purpose, often
in areas that are outside of the scope of scientific investigation. This
distinction allows for a more nuanced understanding of both realms. Science
does not disprove faith, nor can faith undermine science. They complement each
other, contributing to our understanding in unique ways.

## When Acts of Faith Become Science

Acts of faith can evolve into science as technology progresses and new tools
become available to test and falsify ideas that were once untestable. What may
begin as a belief based on limited information can eventually be validated
through advancements in research, experimentation, and observation.

A historical example of this is the theory of atoms. Around 400 BC, the Greek
philosopher Democritus theorized that all matter was composed of indivisible
atoms. At the time, there was no way to test or observe this idea, so it was a
belief rooted in logical reasoning and philosophical thought. It was not until
the 19th and 20th centuries, with advances by scientists like John Dalton and
J.J. Thomson, that experimental evidence confirmed the existence of atoms.
However, Democritus’s original model was far from accurate. Atoms were not
indivisible, but were composed of subatomic particles like electrons, protons,
and neutrons.

This example illustrates how acts of faith, based on speculative ideas, can
become the foundation for scientific discovery as technology evolves. What
began as a speculative belief can eventually become a scientifically testable
theory. This shows how the boundaries between science and faith are not always
fixed but can shift as our capacity to observe and measure improves. Future
technological breakthroughs may continue to elevate contemporary faith-based
ideas, transforming them into scientifically testable theories.

## When Science Becomes an Act of Faith

The opposite is also true. Sometimes, science becomes an act of faith when
previously established theories are disproven, but people dogmatically cling
to them despite new evidence. This is especially true of older scientific
theories that may have seemed incontrovertible at the time but are eventually
replaced as our understanding deepens. This position is generally seen as a
failure of the scientific mindset rather than a valid application of faith.

This phenomenon can be seen in how some legacy religious beliefs are based on
the accumulated observations and experiences at the time these best practices
were codified. In many cases, religious beliefs can be seen as old science or
precursors to modern science in the very literal sense. Whether intended as a
health measure or a ritual boundary, the Mosaic prohibition of shellfish
functioned as an empirical safeguard. It used the authority of divine decree
to enforce a behavior that modern science now validates through our knowledge
of how filter-feeders concentrate toxins. Similarly, the prohibition of pork
provided a communal defense against trichinosis long before the microbiology
of parasites was understood. In both cases, the "why" was framed by faith, but
the "what" was rooted in observable, albeit primitive, science.

It is important to note that this is not a critique of religious faith, but
rather an exploration of how faith and science interact in the context of
human understanding. People’s core worldly and existential concerns remain
largely the same, regardless of technological advancements. What changes are
the tools and frameworks we use to address those concerns. In many cases,
religious traditions offer valuable guidance, communal support, moral
teachings, and behavioral best practices. The best practices from hundreds or
thousands of years ago are often still the best practices because biological
humans remain effectively the same. Some long-standing beliefs have been
refined by scientific discoveries.

There is also a forward-facing aspect of science that is, in itself, an act of
faith. Some scientific theories are proposed without conclusive evidence or
methods for falsification. In such cases, scientists may hold these ideas in
anticipation of future discoveries. This is an act of faith in the potential
of future knowledge. Curiosity alone is not always enough. The belief that
exploration will yield answers propels scientific inquiry forward, even when
individuals obstinately cling to speculative positions as they are actively
disproven.

## For More Information: Key Thinkers in Philosophy of Science

If you are interested in exploring the boundaries of science and belief
further, the following philosophers provided the foundational frameworks for
these discussions.

**Karl Popper (*The Logic of Scientific Discovery*)**

- **Core Thesis:** Popper is the father of **falsifiability**. He argued that
science is distinguished from "pseudoscience" or metaphysics not by being
"proven true," but by being capable of being proven false. If a theory cannot
be tested against reality, it is not scientific.

**Thomas Kuhn (*The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*)**

- **Core Thesis:** Kuhn introduced the **"Paradigm Shift."** He argued that
science does not always progress in a straight, logical line. Instead, it
operates within a "paradigm" until too many anomalies build up, leading to a
revolution that completely changes the scientific worldview. An example is the
shift from Newton's to Einstein's model of physics.

**Stephen Jay Gould (*Rocks of Ages*)**

- **Core Thesis:** Gould proposed the concept of **Non-Overlapping
Magisteria**, which holds that science and religion occupy two separate
domains, or magisteria, that do not overlap. This is the academic version of
orthogonality. Science covers the empirical realm and explains what the
universe is made of, while religion covers the realm of ultimate meaning and
moral value.

**Imre Lakatos (*Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes*)**

- **Core Thesis:** Lakatos sought a middle ground between Popper and Kuhn. He
described science as a "research programme" with a "hard core" of beliefs that
scientists protect from being falsified by creating a "protective belt" of
auxiliary hypotheses. This explains why scientists sometimes "have faith" in a
theory even when early evidence seems to contradict it.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, science and faith are not opposing forces locked in a zero-sum
game, but rather orthogonal dimensions of the human experience. Science
provides the rigorous, falsifiable framework for understanding the "how" of
the physical universe, while faith provides the necessary trust and purpose to
navigate the "why" of our existence. As we have seen through historical
examples like the Mosaic dietary laws or the evolution of atomic theory, the
boundary between these two realms is dynamic. What begins as an act of faith
can become scientific fact or confirmed superstition as our tools for
measurement improve.

By recognizing this orthogonality, we can move past the false choice between
being "rational" or "believing." Everyone, from the scientist proposing a new
theory to the commuter driving to work, operates on a blend of empirical
evidence and fundamental faith. Acknowledging the unique roles of both allows
us to approach the world with greater clarity, embracing scientific progress
without discarding the profound meaning and practical wisdom that faith
provides.
