## Current Task

**Name**: Fix A91 Widget Source Code (A91-P2)
**Status**: Complete
**Started**: 2026-02-16

## Success Criteria

- [x] CLMM Mathematics (A91) has fixed example code and is release candidate status.

## Task Breakdown

| ID | Task | Status | Verification |
|----|------|--------|--------------|
| A91-P2-T1 | Rename exported function to inject_ui | Complete | Renamed `clmm_calculator_init` to `inject_ui` in 4 locations: live script tag (line 96/99), Rust `#[wasm_bindgen]` function definition (line 528), Widget JS Injection Anchor Example (line 751/754). User's `index.html` example (line 847/850) already used `inject_ui`. |
| A91-P2-T2 | Update process files and commit | Complete | TASKLOG and REVERSE_PROMPT updated. |

## Notes

- The `SyntaxError: Importing binding name 'inject_ui' is not found` was caused by the Rust function being exported as `clmm_calculator_init` while the user's `index.html` imported `inject_ui`.
- Human added an `index.html` local testing example and a sample serve command to the article.
- Next available article number: A92.
- 6 release candidates: A86, A87, A88, A89, A90, A91.
- 0 stubs.
