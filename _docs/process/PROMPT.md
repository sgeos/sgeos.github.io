# Prompt Staging Area

This file is a staging area for complex human-to-AI instructions. The human pilot drafts and refines prompts here before execution.

# Current Prompt

## Comments

I want to integrate Claude Code functionality into my blog.

## Objectives

### Add Knowledge Graph

Review the knowledge graph in the following project.
`${HOME}projects/crypto/cordial_cantina/docs/process`

The following file should give you an entry point into the knowledge graph.
`${HOME}projects/crypto/cordial_cantina/docs/process/CLAUDE.md`

Use it as an example to generate a knowledge graph for this project.
Note that is a very simple project.
It is just a technical blog.
Writing conventions are the main thing that should be documented.

The knowledge graph should be located in `_docs`

### Add Bidirectional Communication

I added `_docs/process/PROMPT.md` and `_docs/process/REVERSE_PROMPT.md`.
`PROMPT.md` is for me to draft longform prompts so that:

- they are not lost
- and my prompt history is part of the repo

`REVERSE_PROMPT.md` is for AI agent to communicate questions, comments, and concerns to the human pilot.

Review the knowledge in the following project.
`${HOME}projects/crypto/cordial_cantina/docs/process`

Make sure that the bidirectional communication protocol is replicated for this project.

### Nominal MILESTONE.md Integration

The reference project appears to be using `docs/process/MILESTONE.md` for task resolution for legacy reasons.
I suspect the name of the file should be changed.
Please suggest a name for the file that reflects it current function.
If the file is integral to the bidirectional task resolution, please use your suggested name in this project.
Either way, report on file in your reverse prompt.

### Reverse Prompt

Voice any questions, comments, concerns, or noteworthy observations in your reverse prompt.

## Context

Pulling established workflow from another project.

## Constraints

Do not modify any blog related contents, just documentation.
Do not modify the reference project, just review it and pull relevant procedures.

## Success Criteria

- Appropriate knowledge graph added to this project.
- Bidirectional Agentic Communication protocol documented in knowledge graph.
- `MILESTONE.md` functionality integrated into workflow under appropriate name.

## Notes

(none)
