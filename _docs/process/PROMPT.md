# Current Prompt

## Comments

Answering questions to solidify process.

## Objectives

### Decision: Same-Date Ordering

In general, an effort is made to avoid same date publication.
If multiple drafts are finished on the same day:

- One may be published using thing previous day's date if nothing had been published the previous day.
- One is published for the current day.
- The rest of the articles are treated as unpublished drafts to be published in the future.

If two drafts are indeed published on the same day, they should simply use their assigned article numbers.
In general, article number should indicate publication order regardless of same date publication.
Having said that, unpublished drafts may be tactically published, resulting in slightly out of order publication.

Please make sure this process is documented in the knowledge graph.

### Clarification: Current Draft Numbering

The current drafts can remain unnumbered.
Numbers can be assigned if and when a decision is made to polish these drafts and publish them.

### Draft New Article

Please draft a new article: "Bidirectional Agentic Workflow".
Start by researching the topic.
The article outline:

- Post summary (note that this article was drafted using the bidirectional workflow covered below)
- Software versions
- Document our birdirectional protocol in a way that can be replicated by others (linking to the github repo is OK; note that fine structure may change, but top levels files including `docs/README.md` should be present moving forward)
- Compare the documented workflow to other workflows and strategies found while researching
- Summary
- Future reading
- References (include all relevant references found during research)
