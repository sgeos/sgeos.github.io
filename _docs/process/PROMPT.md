# Current Prompt

## Comments

Polishing draft A75.

Answers to questions.

1. Article tone is fine. Specific edits will be mentioned below.
2. Links only need to be verified once because drafts are usually published promptly.
3. In general, I want to avoid pulling images in if I can help it. If there are more polished options than ASCII art, like HTML/CSS or mermaid diagrams, feel free to use them.
4. Publication timing is fine. Sometimes it is updated immediately before publication.

## Objectives

### Verify Manual Edits

I manually edited the article and made some minor but important changes.
The biggest change was inlining `COMMUNICATION.md`.
Make sure these edits are integrated correctly.
Feel free to move sections around or reword language if sensible.

### Sort Links

Links contents are fine, but I like them listed by category and title in alpha order.
Non-prescriptive illustrative example:
- [AI, Agentic AI Course][ai_agentic_course]
- [AI, My LLM Coding Workflow Going into 2026][ai_llm_workflow]
- [Claude Code, Best Practices for Claude Code][cc_best_practices]
- [Claude Code, Common Workflows: Claude Code Documentation][cc_common_workflows]
- [Claude Code, Eight Trends Defining How Software Gets Built in 2026][cc_eight_trends]

Please sort links and document reference strategy in the knowledge graph.
