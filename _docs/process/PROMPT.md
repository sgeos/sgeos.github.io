## Comments

A75 is an internal article code that means nothing to readers.
We need to revise the article and replace it with something meaningful.

## Objectives

### Replace A75 with Previous Article Reference

```markdown
The bidirectional communication protocol described in A75, for example,
```

should be replace with something like this

```markdown
The bidirectional communication protocol described in [the previous article][blog_bidirectional], for example,
```

The link name can be more formal.
The previous article should be linked in the references if it is included in this post.
I often crosslink posts like this.

## Context

Polishing article for immediate publication.
