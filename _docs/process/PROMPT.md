# Current Prompt

## Comments

`assets` contains some random disorganized files.
I want them moved to proper subdirectories, and I want the articles that reference these files patched.
`assets/wasm` is already organized.

Each `assets` file is probably only referenced in one post.
The files were probably added with the posts, so there might be a `git` trick to figure out the right posts.
Posts may be published or in drafts.

I think the images may be for a trigonometry post.
One of the PDFs may be related to an Elixir meetup I wrote a post for.

## Objectives

### Organize Files and Patch Posts

Move random disorganized `assets` files into proper subdirectories.
Patch posts that reference these files to point to the new location.

## Context

Housekeeping.

## Constraints

(no comment)

## Success Criteria

- `assets` organized.
- Relevant posts patched so they do not break.

## Notes

Please report on the specific patched posts in your reverse prompt.
