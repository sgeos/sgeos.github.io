# Current Prompt

## Comments

Answering questions to solidify process.

## Objectives

### Decision: Article Numbering

Use A0 for non-article work.
Please make sure this process is documented in the knowledge graph.

### Clarification: Commit Convention

Make sure to commit PROMPT.md if it has changed.
This way, the human pilot prompt and AI reverse prompt are always in sync with committed work.
Please make sure this process is documented in the knowledge graph.

### Add Article Comment to Template.

Add `<!-- Axxx -->` to the template file.
Make sure there is a blank line between the Jekyll front matter and the comment.
Make sure there is a blank line between the comment and the first line of post content.
Please make sure this strategy is documented in the knowledge graph.

### Code Historical Articals

Add `<!-- Axxx -->` with an appropriate article number to top of every historical published article.
Make sure there is a blank line between the Jekyll front matter and the comment.
Make sure there is a blank line between the comment and the first line of post content.
The first published article is A1.

## Context

Formalizing article publishing procedures.

## Constraints

Do not modify any blog body contents, just add the article number.

## Success Criteria

- All decisions and clarification documented in appropriate place in the knowledge graph.
- Templated article number added to template file.
- Article numbers added to historical posts.

## Notes

Do not worry about recoding historical commits.
We are focused on improving the process moving forward.
