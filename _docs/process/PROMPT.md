## Comments

### Answers to Questions

1. Scope and depth are fine. I want a section added. Length is not an issue. Some posts are longer than others.
2. Thank you. (Not a question.)
3. Thank you. (Not a question.)
4. Yes. Addressing natural language myopia supports my thesis.
5. Yes, the date needs to be updated. Software versions ought to be the same.

### Responding to Concerns

- A supplementary research pass makes sense.
- URL verification was completed manually.

## Objectives

### Knowledge Graph Update

Categories should not use commas.
Please document in the knowledge graph.

### Update Date

Please run the specified date command and use it to update the date in header and software versions.

### Add Section: Code Blocks

Please add a section on code blocks.
Note that they can be use when more formal specification is in order.
Also, note that the language can be specified. For example:

```sh
echo "${SHELL}"
```

Additionally, note that nested code blocks can be used be used when markdown needs to be communicated.

````markdown
```sh
echo "${SHELL}"
```
````

Note that this is a rare case where a pentuple tick code block may be need to be used.

This sections should also contain any additional analysis that supports the thesis.

### Supplementary Research Pass

Please conduct a supplementary research pass and fold findings into the article.

## Context

Polishing article for immediate publication.

## Constraints

(no comment)

## Success Criteria

- Knowledge graph updated.

- Code block section included to specification.
- Supplementary research pass complete, with results folded into the article.

## Notes

Minor manual edits made.
