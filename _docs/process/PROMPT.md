# Current Prompt

## Comments

`CLAUDE.md` is listed in the header of the live blog but not the preview.
This is a problem I want resolved.

## Objectives

### Fix Header

Attempt fix and report speculative analysis.

## Context

Header is not right after integrating Claude Code into the repo.
Timing is unclear.

## Constraints

(no comment)

## Success Criteria

- `CLAUDE.md` no longer linked in header on live blog.

## Notes

I will push the commit and verify manually.
