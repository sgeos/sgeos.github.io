# Current Prompt

## Comments

Answering questions to solidify process.

## Objectives

### Decision: Git Strategy

Please adapt the git strategy from the reference project.
Exclude anything that is too formal for a blog.
For example GitHub issues are not necessary.

### Decision: Commit Convention

Scoped conventional commits should be used moving forward.
Additionally, commit changes after all other tasks, including the reverse prompt update, are complete.
Please make sure this process is documented in the knowledge graph.

### Decision: Working Item Coding System

Please use Ax-Py-Tz coding.
It stands for Article X, Prompt Y, Task Z.
If possible, every future post should have an article number embedded as an invisible comment at the top of the post.

### Clarification: Commit Convention

PROMPT.md should never be modified by the AI agent.
Treat it as a read-only file.
Please make sure this process is documented in the knowledge graph.

## Context

Clarifying agentic collaborative process.

## Constraints

Do not modify any blog related contents, just documentation.
Do not modify the reference project, just review it and pull relevant procedures.

## Success Criteria

- All decisions and clarification documented in appropriate place in the knowledge graph.

## Notes

(none)
