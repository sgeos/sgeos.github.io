# Post Structure

> **Navigation**: [Writing](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

Structural conventions for blog posts, from front matter through references.

## Front Matter

Every post requires YAML front matter with these fields.

```yaml
---
layout: post
mathjax: false
comments: true
title: "Descriptive Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000
categories: category-one, category-two
---
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `layout` | Yes | Always `post` |
| `mathjax` | Yes | Set `true` only when the post contains LaTeX math |
| `comments` | Yes | Set `true` to enable Disqus comments |
| `title` | Yes | Quoted, descriptive title |
| `date` | Yes | UTC timezone (`+0000`) |
| `categories` | Yes | Comma-separated, lowercase, hyphenated where needed |

**Title reminder**: The draft template title reads "Template, Add Category Before You Forget" as a deliberate prompt to set categories before drafting.

## Article Number

Every post should include an invisible HTML comment with its article number immediately after the front matter closing `---`. The article number is a monotonically increasing identifier that ties the post to the Ax-Py-Tz work item coding system documented in [Communication](../process/COMMUNICATION.md).

```markdown
---
layout: post
mathjax: false
comments: true
title: "Post Title"
date: 2026-02-07 00:00:00 +0000
categories: example
---
<!-- A5 -->
```

The comment is not rendered in the published HTML. It serves as a traceability anchor for associating prompts and tasks with the post they support.

## Standard Sections

Posts follow a consistent section order. Not all sections appear in every post.

1. **Opening prose** (no heading). Introductory paragraph describing the problem or topic.
2. **Interactive elements** (optional). Inline HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for embedded widgets or WebAssembly modules.
3. **`## Software Versions`**. Command output showing the environment. Always includes `date -u`, `uname -vm`, and any relevant tool versions.
4. **`## Instructions`**. Primary content with implementation steps, code blocks, and explanations. May use `###` subheadings for distinct steps.
5. **`## References`**. Bullet list of reference-style links. Appears at the end of every post.

### Optional Sections

- `## Conclusion` for summary and takeaways.
- `## Future Reading` for supplementary resources beyond the references list.
- `## From Math to Code` for posts that transition from theory to implementation.

## Software Versions Format

```sh
$ date -u "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S +0000"
2026-01-31 12:10:25 +0000

$ uname -vm
Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: ...
```

Include version output for every language, framework, or tool used in the post.

## Interactive Elements

Posts that embed interactive content follow this pattern.

1. A `<style>` block with scoped CSS classes for the widget.
2. An HTML `<div>` container with a unique element ID.
3. A `<script type="module">` block that imports and initializes the widget. The script's `id` attribute serves as the anchor element that gets replaced.

WebAssembly assets live in `/assets/wasm/<post_slug>/` and are generated by `wasm-bindgen` from Rust source.

## Categories

Categories are lowercase and hyphenated. Common categories include but are not limited to: `ai`, `ai-tools`, `crypto`, `defi`, `development`, `developer-productivity`, `elixir`, `freebsd`, `gamedev`, `macos`, `mobile`, `philosophy`, `rust`, `tutorial`.

## File Naming

- Drafts: `_drafts/<slug>.markdown`
- Published: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.markdown`
- Hidden drafts (gitignored): `hidden.<slug>.markdown`

The `_publish.sh` script extracts the date from front matter and prepends it to the filename during publication.
