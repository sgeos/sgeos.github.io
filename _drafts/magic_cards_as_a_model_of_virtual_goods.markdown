[Magic the Gathering][mtg] has been described as the best
[game ever made][mtg-best].
Best is a matter of opinion, but it is hard to argue with the success of Magic.
It started the collectable card game boom, and Magic  is still making money
30 years later.

Magic cards contain an incredibly dense amount of information that can serve
as a good model for virtual goods and general game tokens.
This post will cover the contents of a Magic card and how the cards serve
as a physical model for virtual goods.
It will also translate this information into [Rust][rust] data structures.
